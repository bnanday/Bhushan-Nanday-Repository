Best case = O(n)
Worst case = O(n2)
Average case = O(n2)

Best case:

Its best to use insertion sort when the array is almost or fully sorted and it makes less comparisons because the 
while loop condition is false.

Average case:

On an average case for a random data only half of the maximum number of comparisons possible are made. Hence,
it runs faster than bubble and selection sort for the random data.
